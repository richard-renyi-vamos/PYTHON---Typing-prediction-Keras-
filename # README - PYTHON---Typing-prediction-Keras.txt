To predict words based on typing, we can train a simple text prediction model using Python and the Keras library. Weâ€™ll create a recurrent neural network (RNN) with LSTM layers that can learn sequences of words from a text corpus and predict the next word based on the sequence typed so far.

Here's how we can set it up:

python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
from keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense
from keras.utils import to_categorical

# Sample text data (you can use a large corpus of text data for better accuracy)
data = """Your sample text corpus goes here. 
          The model will learn to predict the next word based on the typed sequence."""

# Tokenize the data
tokenizer = Tokenizer()
tokenizer.fit_on_texts([data])
total_words = len(tokenizer.word_index) + 1

# Create sequences for model training
input_sequences = []
for line in data.split('.'):
    token_list = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([line])[0]
    for i in range(1, len(token_list)):
        n_gram_sequence = token_list[:i+1]
        input_sequences.append(n_gram_sequence)

# Pad sequences and create predictors and labels
max_sequence_len = max([len(x) for x in input_sequences])
input_sequences = np.array(pad_sequences(input_sequences, maxlen=max_sequence_len, padding='pre'))

# Split data into predictors and label
X, y = input_sequences[:,:-1], input_sequences[:,-1]
y = to_categorical(y, num_classes=total_words)

# Define the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(total_words, 100, input_length=max_sequence_len-1))
model.add(LSTM(150))
model.add(Dense(total_words, activation='softmax'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
print(model.summary())

# Train the model
history = model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, verbose=1)

# Function to predict the next word
def predict_next_word(seed_text, max_sequence_len):
    token_list = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([seed_text])[0]
    token_list = pad_sequences([token_list], maxlen=max_sequence_len-1, padding='pre')
    predicted = np.argmax(model.predict(token_list, verbose=0), axis=-1)
    output_word = ""
    for word, index in tokenizer.word_index.items():
        if index == predicted:
            output_word = word
            break
    return output_word

# Test the model
seed_text = "Your starting phrase"
print("Next word prediction:", predict_next_word(seed_text, max_sequence_len))
Code Explanation
Text Preparation: We tokenize the data into a sequence of words, creating smaller n-gram sequences that the model can learn from. Each sequence is a possible typing sequence, with the last word as the target prediction.

Model Definition: We use an Embedding layer to convert words to vector embeddings and an LSTM layer to capture sequential patterns in typing. The Dense layer with softmax activation predicts the probability of the next word.

Prediction Function: The function predict_next_word takes a typed sequence and predicts the most likely next word using the trained model.

Training: Train the model with a large number of epochs to improve accuracy. You can expand the dataset to make the predictions more accurate.

For more extensive use, this can be adapted to handle larger datasets like entire books or articles, allowing the model to learn a richer vocabulary and more complex sequences.
